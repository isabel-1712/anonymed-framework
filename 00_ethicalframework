# Ethical Framework for the ANONY-MED Toolbox

Our ethical framework structure follows the broad structure of the Ethical guidelines for **Trustworthy AI** of the EU's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG) [1]. These guidelines aim to promote the development and deployment of AI systems that are safe, reliable, and respect fundamental rights and values. The guidelines include seven key principles for trustworthy AI that count as high-level norms and several sub-groups under these heading counting as mid-level norms:

1.	Human agency and oversight
  1.	  Fundamental rights
  2.	Human agency
  3.	Human oversight
2.	Technical robustness and safety
  1.	Resilience to attack and security
  2.	Fallback plan and general safety
  3.	Accuracy
  4.	Reliability and Reproducibility
3.	Privacy and Data governance
  1.	Privacy and data protection
  2.	Quality and integrity of data
  3.	Access to data
4.	Transparency
  1.	Traceability
  2.	Explainability
  3.	Communication
5.	Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness
  1.	Avoidance of unfair bias
  2.	Accessibility and universal design
  3.	Stakeholder participation
6.	Societal and environmental well-being
  1.	Sustainable and environmentally friendly
  2.	Social impact
  3.	Society and Democracy
7.	Accountability
  1.	Auditability
  2.	Minimisation and reporting of negative impacts
  3.	Trade-offs
  4.	Redress

These guidelines define a structure of high- and mid-level norms. High-level norms are equivalent to high-level principles, for example “Transparency”. These principles are then further defined by mid-level norms, for example “Explainability”. The descriptions of the high- and mid-level norms below are taken verbatim from [1].
For each mid-level norm, we provide ethical guidance in the form of questions. Our framework is not a checklist since it requires free form answers and it requires justifications. The checklist we devised is loosely based on the ALTAI checklist (cite 2).
